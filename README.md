- Hi, Iâ€™m @denisveller. I am an aerospace engineering major at Georgia Tech. 
- The only "good" stuff here is TLI_Time_Calulator. 
- The only code that gets any updates is dominion-generator, which I use regularly.
- This is a mix of code I wrote[1] for personal or school projects, in high school and now in college. Most of it is trash, some of it doesn't work, and the only code of any intrest is a rudimentary launch window calculator for translunar trajectories, is still pretty bad as I wrote it in high school. Eventually, my more recent code for orbital analysis will be on here too, but as of now that is not the case.
- You can find me on linkedin if this peaked your intrest.
- [1] Snake-workshop is mostly, if not entirley, a re-used example project from Javascript for kids. Also, everything else was heavily stack-overflowed, like all bad code is.
