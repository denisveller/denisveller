- Hi, Iâ€™m @denisveller. I am an aerospace engineering major at Georgia Tech. 
- The only proffessional relevant code on here is "nBody," an n-body physics simulator I am working on.
- Otheriwse, this code is a mix of coursework and personal projects, some of which date back to high school. Some of it, particularly anything to do with HTML front end, is pretty rough, but it works for the purposes of my personal projects.
- You can find me on linkedin if this peaked your intrest.
