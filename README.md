- Hi, Iâ€™m @denisveller. I am an aerospace engineering major at Georgia Tech. This is a mix of code I wrote[1] for personal or school projects, in high school and now in college. Most of it is trash, some of it doesn't work, and the only code I'm actually proud of, a rudimentary launch window calculator, isn't even here.  
- You can find me on linkedin if, for some reason, this mess peaked your intrest.
- [1] Snake-workshop is mostly, if not entirley, a re-used example project from Javascript for kids. Also, everything else was heavily stack-overflowed, like all bad code is.
